On the start of the game:
- The initial cell should be included into the trailpoints
- Perform a player's event on the initial cell (wormholes, bear, map, treasure)

Fix rendering:
- !Player:(0,0) - this is an indication of a bug in a render (exclamation mark is indicating about a bug)
-- Reason: the rendering function assumes that the player position is always available in the Labyrinth data structure.
   This is true for the labyrinth, but not true for trailpoints.
