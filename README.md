The Hydra Project
=================

This project demonstrates the principles of Software Design and Architecture in pure Functional Programming. It provides a framework implemented with several different approaches for easy comparison:

- Final Tagless
- Free Monad
- Church Encoded Free Monad

Hydra Framework
---------------

An all-in-one framework for writing Haskell apps which use the following features out of the box:

- Multithreading
- Safe STM-powered concurrency
- Logging
- Random data generation
- Many others

With the framework, you can create complex applications that have a good maintainability, testability, simplicity, that have a good structure and are easy to read and change. The key principles in the framework:

- Layered architecture
- Separation of Business Logic, Runtime and Implementation
- Convenient and simple to use eDSLs for Business Logic
- Layered structure of business application: State, Domain, Business Logic
