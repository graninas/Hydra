The Hydra Project
=================

An all-in-one framework for constructing Haskell apps with the following
possibilities out of the box:

- Multithreading
- Safe STM-powered concurrency
- Logging
- Random data generation
- Many others

With the framework, you can create complex applications that have
a good maintainability, testability, simplicity, that have a good structure
and are easy to read and change. The key principles in the framework:

- Layered architecture
- Separation of Business Logic, Runtime and Implementation
- Convenient and simple to use eDSLs for Business Logic
- Layered structure of business application: State, Domain, Business Logic

This project demonstrates the principles of Software Design and Architecture
in pure Functional Programming.
